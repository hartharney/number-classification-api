# number-classification-apiNumber Classification API

Welcome to the Number Classification API, a simple yet powerful tool to classify numbers based on their mathematical properties and provide fun facts. This API was built using Express.js and deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for public access. üöÄ

Project Description
This API allows users to send a number as a query parameter and get a JSON response with:

Whether the number is an Armstrong number.
If it's odd or even.
The sum of its digits.
A fun fact fetched from the Numbers API.
It's designed to handle input validation, return appropriate HTTP responses, and ensure fast performance for seamless integration into any application.

Features
üöÄ Publicly accessible via a deployed endpoint.
üåê Handles CORS for cross-origin requests.
üßÆ Returns well-structured JSON responses.
üíæ Lightweight and scalable with clean code organization.
